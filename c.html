    <p>
Welcome to Flavors of the Worl, a website created to explore and celebrate the amazing variety of food from different cultures around the globe. Food is more than just something we eat — it tells stories, reflects traditions, and connects people from all walks of life.

The main purpose of this website is to help students and visitors learn about the traditional dishes, ingredients, and cooking styles of different countries. Each dish carries a piece of its country’s history and lifestyle. Through our pages, you can discover how cultures express their identity through taste, color, and creativity.

OurFood Gallery showcases delicious and famous dishes from across the world — from Italian pasta to Japanese sushi and Indian biryani. Every photo is a glimpse into a country’s culture and its love for food.

This project was made as part of class 10 school assignmen to promote cultural understanding through food. We believe that by learning about what people eat, we can also learn to appreciate our differences and similarities.

So, come join us on this flavorful journey and explore how food unites the world, one dish at a time! 🌍🍽️
